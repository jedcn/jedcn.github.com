{"name":"jedcn","tagline":"friend","body":"### Projects on Github\r\n\r\nI've taken to giving talks recently, and I really dig [reveal.js][reveal.js].\r\n\r\nI wrote a quick command line tool that transforms a minimal description of your slides into a full blown reveal.js presentation. It's a 'reveal.js construction kit' and is called [reveal-ck][reveal-ck].\r\n\r\n### Talks on Github\r\n\r\nI have been working on a series of talks about \"Learning.\"\r\n\r\nThe two basic ideas behind the \"Learning Series\" are:\r\n\r\n* As knowledge workers, Learning is fundamental to both our day-to-day happiness and our long-term happiness with our career.\r\n* The better we get at Learning the happier we will become.\r\n\r\nThe talks that exist right now are:\r\n\r\n##### Learning with RSpec\r\n\r\nMain Idea: If you look at this 'BDD' tool in the right light, it can be something that helps us explore new technology and better retain and reference what we've found.\r\n\r\nTalk: [source][learning-with-rspec-notes]\r\n\r\nSlides: [generated][learning-with-rspec-slides-generated], [source][learning-with-rspec-slides-source]\r\n\r\n##### Learning with Tools\r\n\r\nMain Idea: Everyday we're working with various tools to get our jobs done. We should be sharing these tools, what we like about what, what could be improved. If we do so, we'll be better off for it. This talk encompasses some of the \"tools\" that I use in my daily job.\r\n\r\nTalk: [source][learning-with-tools-notes]\r\n\r\nSlides: [generated][learning-with-tools-slides-generated], [source][learning-with-tools-slides-source]\r\n\r\n[reveal.js]: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/\r\n[reveal-ck]: https://github.com/jedcn/reveal-ck\r\n[learning-with-rspec-notes]: https://github.com/jedcn/talk-learning-with-rspec/blob/master/talk.md\r\n[learning-with-rspec-slides-generated]: http://www.jednorthridge.com/talks/learning-with-rspec/\r\n[learning-with-rspec-slides-source]: https://github.com/jedcn/talk-learning-with-rspec/blob/master/slides.haml\r\n[learning-with-tools-notes]: https://github.com/jedcn/talk-learning-with-tools/blob/master/README.md\r\n[learning-with-tools-slides-generated]: http://www.jednorthridge.com/talks/learning-with-tools/\r\n[learning-with-tools-slides-source]: https://github.com/jedcn/talk-learning-with-tools/blob/master/slides.haml\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
