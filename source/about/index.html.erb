<h3>Why?</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote-large">
  You should always have a side project, too. Side projects give you
  an outlet, provide a useful distraction, let you explore new ideas,
  learn new concepts, and generally give you the freedom to be
  unaccountable. You don't have to worry about your boss or your
  coworkers ... Just have some fun. Treat yourself.

<h3>What?</h3>

<p>
  I build things that I find useful, and I am happy to share.
</p>

<p>
  I usually work in <%= link_to 'node', '/categories/#node' %> or
  <%= link_to 'ruby', '/categories/#ruby' %>, but technology choices
  aren't the focus.
</p>

<p>
  Instead I focus on helping the people around me.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Hundreds of engineers, scientists, and educators have used
    <%= link_to 'reveal-ck', '/projects/reveal-ck' %> to build
    presentations.
  </li>
  <li>
    My team members get direct HipChats whenever their projects build
    or their code is deployed with
    <%= link_to 'hipchat-hotline', '/projects/hipchat-hotline' %>.
  </li>
  <li>
    I've built custom
    <%= link_to 'lint rules', '/projects/coffeelint-prefer-fewer-parens' %>
    so that my team can enforce their styles programmatically.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dozens of my co-workers continue to use
    <%= link_to 'getting-started-with-slate', '/projects/getting-started-with-slate' %>
    as their first Window Manager.
  </li>
</ul>
